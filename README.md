# Awesome-Papers-Autonomous-Agent

This is a collection of recent papers focusing on autonomous agent. Here is how Wikipedia defines Agent:

> In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent is an agent acting in an intelligent manner; It perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or acquiring knowledge. An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostator other control systemis considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.

Thus, the key of an agent is that it can <i>achieve goals</i>, <i>acquire knowledge</i> and <i>continually improve</i>.
The traditional agents in RL research will not be considered in this collection.
Though LLM-based agents have caught people's eyes in recent research, RL-based agents also take their special position.
Specifically, this repo is interested in two types of agent: RL-based agent and LLM-based agent. 

Note that this paper list is **under active maintaince**. Free free to open an issue if you found any missed papers that fit the topic.
